Goals

By the end of this lesson, you will know/be able to:

* Understand what Object Oriented Programming is
* How to create and use Objects in Javascript
* How to create blueprints (prototypes) for your objects in Javascript

### Structure

#### Hook: <5 min
* General overview on object oriented programming
* Discuss a few of the differences between OOP with a class based language, and
  with a Prototype language.
* Go over benefits of unit testing with Objects.

#### Opening: 1-2 min

* Intro to Object Oriented Programming with Javascript
* By then end of the class, students should be able to create a new Object,
  alter it's properties, and create a prototype for other Objects.
  goals?

  #### Introduction to New Material (I do)

  * instructor explains Objects, properties, and prototypes with Javascript
  * Examples: lecture, slides, code demonstration

  #### Guided Practice (We do)

  * instructor and students both "doing"
  * Ask students for an example of something they would like to create an Object
    for.  Ask for what properties are likely to be shared across all Objects
    created from a prototype, and which ones they think will be different.
    Instructor will code out suggestions from students letting them think though
    how to model objects with an OOP approach.

    #### Independent/Pair Practice (You do)

    * students "doing", instructor available as lifeline
    * working from questions from a Gist, students will implement basic objects,
      protypes, and objects created from a prototype to re-inforce lesson with
      instructor providing help as needed.

    #### The Closing: ~5 min

    * Check for understanding
    * Discuss any clarifications or student misconceptions
    * Review goals, further resources, and next steps

          Basics of OOP

          What is an `Object`?.  An `Object` Allow us to represent the things
          from the real world in code, and hold useful information about that
          particular object.

          Creating a basic Object.

          ```js
            var myObject = {}
          ```
        </section>
        <section data-markdown>
          Within our `Objects`, we have `properties` and `values`
          Think of a property as a name or category for the information inside
          of `value`. We create our properties like:
          
          ```js
            myObject = {
              myFirstProperty: "first property value",
              mySecodProperty: "second property value"
            }
          ```
        <!-- Slide 4 -->
        </section>
        <section data-markdown>
          Generic examples are boring, so let's create an `Object` with some
          information about ourselves

          ```js
          var cody = {
            age: 31,
            profession: 'Software Developer',
            location: 'Denver, CO'
          }
          ```
          To access the value of a property of an `Object`, we just need to
          (you can also call it like object["propertyName"])
          call the property name on the Object
          (syntax highlighting looks like shit)

          ```  
            > cody.age
            31
            > cody.profession
            'Sofware Developer'
          ```

            
        <!--     "Does it make sense to talk about a console and trying to run -->
        <!--     commands and things like that while i'm programming?  They may not -->
        <!--     have even seen node yet." -->
        </section>
        <section data-markdown>
          So far, we've beeen creating our objects using the _object literal
          notation_.  

          We can also use what's called a _constructor_.  To create a new object
          using a _constructor_  The example from above can be created with a
          constructor like 

          ```js
          var cody = new Object();
          cody.age = 31
          cody.profession = "Software Developer"
          ```
        </section>
        <section data-markdown>
          In the previous example, we used a built in constructor called `Object`
          This creates a new object with no properties or methods.  We had
          to set our properties one at a time.

          ```js
            var emptyObject = new Object();
            Object.getOwnPropertyNames(emptyObject);
            (this might be too much?)
            []
          ```
        </section>
        <section data-markdown>
          Setting these values one at a time gets old pretty quick.  Let's make
          our own constructor for a `Person`

          ```js
          function Person(age, profession) {
            this.age = age;
            this.profession = profession;
          }

          var rick = new Person(53, 'Scientist')
          rick.age
          53
          rick.profession
          'Scientist'
          ```
        </section>
        <section data-markdown>
          We dont have to rely on the values passed to the constructor, meaning
          we can set a default value for each new Object we create with our
          constructor

          ```js
          function Person(age, profession) {
            this.age = age;
            this.profession = profession;
            this.school = "Turing School of Software and Design"
          }

          var john = new Person(28, "Baker");
          john.school
          "Turing School of Software and Design"
          ```
        </section>
        <section data-markdown>
          Now, we're starting seeing the benefits ot Object Oriented
          Programming.  We're creating a default value we dont have to worry
          about setting across all of our objects.  We're not just limited to
          setting values for properties, we can also create methods in our
          constructor that will be available in new objects created from the
          constructor.
        </section>
        <section data-markdown>
          ```js
          function Person(age, profession) {
            this.age = age;
            this.profession = profession;
            this.school = "Turing School of Software and Design"
            this.bio = function() {
              return "My name is " + this.name + " and I am " + this.age + "
              years old".  Right now I am a " + this.profession + ". I'm
              currently studying at " + this.school
            }
          }
          ```
